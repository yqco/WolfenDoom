Proximity Flee - Flees when player is close to the actor
Reacts to weapon fire - An actor will fly away if a weapon is shot within 800 map units of it.

Note: All actors flee when shot directly. Some flee upon reacting to weapon sound, or when the player approaches. In any case
they will fly towards the sky and permanently disappear.

A fleeing crow will cause any other crows in a nearby group to flee as well when the above conditions are met.
